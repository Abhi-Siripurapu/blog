I'm Abhi, I'm working on stuff in Bio + AI. My recent interests are in the development of antibody therapuetics using PLMs.

This is mostly an archive of my own thoughts. expect to see a lot of technical stuff, with the occasional breakdown on something I find interesting.

Before, I used to write on Medium, where I was published in organizations with over 700k followers. I'm writing on my own website now for better analytics.
